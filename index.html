and diverge from other members. The staff that manages the consortium has
to be vigilant of current events in the online educational marketplace. The
staff should present this information to the teams and committees, thereby
expanding knowledge and encouraging committee and team members to
think about ways to provide new learning and student services to online and
        traditional students.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources used by CECC include League for Innovation publications
such as<i> Teaching at a Distance</i>e (Boaz et al., 1999), and the<i>Faculty Guide for
Moving Teaching and Learning to the Web </i> (Boettcher & Conrad, 1999).
Another resource that was particularly helpful as the consortium began to
form teams and define team missions was <i>New Connections: A Guide to
Distance Education</i>(Gross, Gross, & Pirkl, 1998), a publication of the
Instructional Telecommunications Council. All of these were useful resources for educating team and committee members.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consortium believes that the key to CCCOnline’s continued success
is the long-term commitment and support of these committees and teams by
our member colleges. The development of CCCOnline initially drove large
change in CC of C and it continues to drive great change. These days however,
the committees and teams that support CCCOnline are used to this change and
excited to be a part of the evolution of CCCOnline. Enrollment in CCCOnline
programs has increased every semester since inception and there’s every
reason to believe that this trend will continue. Online learning has become
mainstream. Our member colleges know that providing high quality online
learning and student services is only possible with continual vigilance and
willingness to change. Witherspoon (1997) states, “the Colorado Model is
one to watch.”

        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter summarizes a report of a systematic study of distance
education programs whose audience was middle- and upper-level managers
employed full-time at two Chinese companies. These programs were evaluated in terms of their educational effectiveness; i.e., did these students, and the
companies who paid for their education, receive good value for their investment of time and money?</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, few studies have attempted to validate benefits or to
substantiate the shortcomings of distance education and associated technologies, especially in the area of international management education. The
conclusions of two of the earliest systematic studies of distance suggested that
using television as a means of delivering instruction to students, regardless of
grade levels or subject matter, <i>could</i> result in student performance that was
equal to that of “live” classes, (Chu & Schramm, 1967; Schramm, 1967).
</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1970s, the engineering school of Stanford University was
approached by Hewlett-Packard (HP) to assist them in expanding the educational and training opportunities for employees working in company facilities
at some distance from Stanford’s campus (and HP’s corporate headquarters).
Based on the early results of Chu and Schramm, Stanford’s engineering
program pioneered the development of an experimental distance education
methodology—Tutored Video Instruction (TVI)—for the purpose of providing graduate engineering education to Hewlett-Packard engineers located in
Santa Rosa, California, approximately 100 miles from Stanford’s campus.
The engineering courses required for Master’s degree completion were
videotaped and were then sent to HP’s plant in Santa Rosa, where the students
met as a group to view and discuss the videotapes once per week. No in-person
(i.e., “live”) contact with the faculty was permitted, and Stanford University
or HP did not support electronic messaging between the students and the
faculty.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A local tutor was hired and trained to direct the students’ learning at the
Santa Rosa site. The tutor was charged with three functions: (1) to distribute
materials for the instructor and to collect assignments; (2) to answer questions
if possible; otherwise, to obtain answers from the instructor; and (3) to
encourage discussion. Initially, the tutor was a retired HP engineer.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluation of these initial TVI courses included these observations
(Gibbons et al., 1977):<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; TVI student grades were statistically higher than those of the on-campus
students (whose “live” class had been taped for subsequent viewing offcampus).<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; Smaller student groups liked TVI more than larger classes.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower the distance student’s undergraduate grade point average
(GPA), the more effective was the TVI experience, as measured by each
student’s grade in the TVI classes.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; Tutors who answered questions directly (i.e., technically proficient)
were less effective than those tutors who drew students into discussion
(i.e., discussion facilitation).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There have been several studies of the effectiveness of TVI since
Stanford’s introductory program. For example, Stone (1990) conducted a
cross-sectional analysis of TVI distance education offerings in engineering
education. The results of this study directly support those of the pioneering
Stanford study. Arentz (1995) conducted a study to compare the effectiveness
of various distance education methodologies employed in teaching engineersing to students in Norway. In direct comparison to other means of learning at
a distance, TVI was clearly the preferred method of learning.
</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1980s, a study comparing the effectiveness of TVI directly to
“live” instruction was undertaken (Appleton et al., 1989). A study of 144
Australian undergraduate students concluded that TVI student performance
was at least equal to that of on-campus students enrolled in live classes at their
main campus. Further, TVI was found to be more effective as a learning
technology when compared to the other forms of distance learning being used
by the institution at the same time: correspondence education, audiotaped
programs, and videotaped courses.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30;text-align: center;"><b>TUTORED VIDEO INSTRUCTION</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, a senior human resources executive from a company in Hong
Kong approached the School of Business and Management (SOBAM) at the
University of San Francisco and asked that SOBAM faculty be used to offer
an MBA program to selected executives of their company. The company was
unable to afford to either pay for such a program if it required “live”
instruction by transporting MBA faculty to Hong Kong or to send their
executives to San Francisco to attend regular MBA classes. Since China had
only recently become “open” to the West, many SOBAM faculty were
interested in pursuing this opportunity. Thus, it was evident that to respond to
this company’s request would require the use of some form of distance
education methodology.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 22"><b>Program Objectives</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, less than one-third of the SOBAM US-born faculty had spent
more than three weeks abroad in any foreign country, and only a very few of
the entire faculty had ever traveled to Asia for any purpose. None of the faculty
had direct experience with distance learning in any form before this experiment.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some investigation, a faculty committee discovered the aforementioned research on TVI and decided to investigate its use further. Two of the
faculty visited Stanford University’s television network where they talked
with the retired engineering faculty member who led the initial HewlettPackard program and some of the technical personnel who responsible for the
videotaping of the classes. They also talked with the initial on-site tutor and
two of the faculty who had taught live classes in engineering, TVI classes, and
on-campus classes that were being taped “live” to be viewed simultaneously
by students at distance locations. From a final review of the research on
distance education, SOBAM faculty made a direct comparison of the research
on various distance learning methodologies (i.e., acquisition; faculty and staff
